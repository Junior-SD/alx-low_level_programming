Low-level programming refers to the development of software that interacts directly with a computer's hardware.
It involves using languages like assembly or machine code, providing minimal abstraction from the underlying architecture.

 Low-level programmers have direct control over hardware components, allowing for optimization of performance.
 This type of programming is common in tasks like operating system development, device drivers, embedded systems, and security analysis.
 It requires a deep understanding of hardware and often involves tasks such as memory management, direct register manipulation, and precise control over hardware resources.

 Debugging low-level code can be challenging due to the lack of abstraction.
 While higher-level languages are more common for general software development, low-level programming is essential for specific applications requiring fine-grained control over hardware.
